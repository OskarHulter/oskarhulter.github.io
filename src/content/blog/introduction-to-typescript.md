Typescript may seem like a foreign language, but mastering it isn't as complicated as you think. Learning it is like teaching your five-year-old self how to write JavaScript - if your five-year-old self has the mental capacity of a genius, that is.

You know the basics of JavaScript already, so why add complexity to an already complex language? Don't worry, you aren't reinventing the wheel here. TypeScript is just an extension of JavaScript, so all the concepts you already know still apply.

TypeScript allows you to take your skills to the next level by incorporating static typing into JavaScript for both server and client.

In this blog post, I'll walk you through the basics of TypeScript in plain English and illustrate examples so simple they're almost child's play – just like talking to my five-year-old self!

## What Is Typescript?

Hey, I know coding can feel like rocket science, but trust me – understanding what Typescript is doesn’t have to be super complicated.

In the simplest of terms, Typescript is an extension to JavaScript (JS).

At its core, Typescript lets you use your object-oriented programming skills and turn them into clear and concise code – code that you can use both on the server side and the client side. You can even  so mastering this language can help speed up your development process significantly!

There are tons of tutorials, books, and other helpful materials that can help you get up to speed with TypeScript quickly.

Not only that, but TypeScript also comes with great IDE support. Most of the major IDEs have support for TypeScript out of the box, as well as a variety of plugins and extensions that can be used to further improve your development environment. This makes it simpler to quickly identify and fix errors during development.

Finally, TypeScript has a great ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that make it even easier to use. Whether you’re building a web application or an API, there’s sure to be an appropriate library for your project.

The bottom line is that TypeScript provides developers with an intuitive and powerful way to build robust web applications. From its ease of use to its scalability, Tauri offers developers a great way to create native apps and optionally sprinkle more advanced programming languages like rust. This let's us iterate fast in TS

Finally, TypeScript is compatible with popular libraries and frameworks. This allows developers to take advantage of existing tools and frameworks to create powerful applications without needing to build everything from scratch. Whether you're working on a web or mobile app, you can easily integrate TypeScript with React, Next, Vue.js, or any of your favorite libraries and frameworks.

## Typescript Example

A simple code example is the best way to learn how something works. For example, let's say I want to create a function that displays the name of a student and their age. In TypeScript, it would look like this:

```js
function showStudent(name: string, age: number) {
  console.log(`Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}`)
}
```

You can see that by declaring each argument with its type, I'm able to use the power of type checking in TypeScript. And if I run this function with valid arguments, I'll get an expected output of 'Name: John Doe, Age: 25'. Neat!

To help you get started with Typescript quickly, there are some great resources available. For example, there are several tutorials available online that can help you get acquainted with the basics. Additionally, there is also a wealth of books and videos to provide deeper insights into the language.

## Advantages of Writing in Typescript

When it comes to writing in Typescript, the biggest advantage is safety—you can catch errors before you even run the code. That's because Typescript is a typed superset of JavaScript, so you can use something like Zod, a runtime type validation library, that works great with Typescript and prevents silly errors like trying to call something a string when it should be an integer. How cool is that?

## Typescript vs Other Languages: Pros and Cons

Typescript is like a lot of other object-oriented languages, such as C# or Java. It is statically typed, meaning each variable needs to be declared with its type before it can be used in the program. This makes it easier to read, debug and refactor your code.

But why use Typescript instead of one of these other languages? Well, it's probably because you want to compile your code into JavaScript for use on the server side or the client side. Compared to other languages, Typescript provides you with access to many of the latest features in JavaScript and also has strong support from Microsoft.

But it's not all "rainbows and unicorns" — there are some drawbacks. For example, you have to decide what type each variable will have before using them in your code. Also, the Typescript compiler can sometimes be slow when compiling large projects with lots of files.

Before you jump in, however, you should understand the pros and cons of Typescript and decide whether it is the right language for your project. One of the biggest advantages of using Typescript is that you can write code in a high-level language and compile it into JavaScript for use on the web. Additionally, the language is well supported by Microsoft, meaning that you can benefit from the latest features and security updates.

On the flip side, there are a few disadvantages to using Typescript that you should be aware of. First, the compiler can be slow when dealing with complex projects. Second, the language is more verbose than some of its competitors, meaning you have to write more code to achieve the same thing.

Ultimately, whether you decide to use Typescript or another language depends on what you are hoping to achieve. However, if you are looking for a high-level language that compiles down to JavaScript and has great support, Typescript might be the right fit for your project.
