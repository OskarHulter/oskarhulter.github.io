  If you’re a web developer, you know how important it is to have code that is well-structured and maintainable. It also needs to be efficient so that your products can quickly load and run correctly. That’s why type driven development has become increasingly popular as an alternative to test driven development (TDD). Let’s explore why this approach may be the better of the two for developing web apps.

## What is Type Driven Development?

Type driven development (TDD) is a programming paradigm focused on structuring programs around types. Types are essentially data structures that define how data should be stored, accessed, and manipulated within a program. In TDD, type information is used to describe how different parts of the program interact with each other in order to ensure that they are properly connected and functioning as expected.  This helps reduce bugs and improves code readability. As a result, developers can focus less on debugging and more on writing clean code that will get the job done efficiently.

## Benefits of TDD

The biggest benefit of TDD over TDD is its emphasis on type safety. By forcing developers to think about how their code interacts with different types of data, it ensures that all inputs are valid before running the program - which helps avoid errors down the line. It also makes it easier for developers to refactor their code since they don't have to worry about breaking existing functionality or introducing new bugs when making changes. Finally, it simplifies unit testing since developers only have to check for correct type information rather than manually testing every possible input scenario as they would have to do with TDD.

## Drawbacks of TDD

The main drawback of TDD is that it can slow down development if the type system isn’t well-defined or understood by all team members. This can lead to issues like long compilation times or incorrect assumptions about how certain types should work together - both of which can cause delays in getting features out the door. Additionally, some developers may find working with types cumbersome or intimidating if they are unfamiliar with them, which could further hamper progress on projects where TDD is being used as a primary development methodology.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, type driven development offers numerous advantages over test
driven development for web app developers who want cleaner code and fewer bugs
down the line. The key is understanding when and how using a typed language like
Typescript or Flow will help you achieve your desired results without
sacrificing speed or efficiency in the process. For web developers looking for
an edge in creating more robust applications faster, type driven development may
be just what you need!
